# 🖼️ Image Identification Request

Hello! I&apos;m ready to make your portfolio even more amazing by using ALL your beautiful images properly.

## What I Need From You:

Could you please tell me:

1. **Which images are devil fruits?** (These will go in the Skills section)
2. **Which image is the 3D ship?** (This will be featured prominently)
3. **Which images are characters?** (Luffy, Sanji, etc. for Hero/About sections)
4. **Any other special images?** (Treasure chests, log poses, etc.)

Once you tell me, I can:
- ✅ Rename them all with descriptive names
- ✅ Use them in the right sections
- ✅ Feature your 3D ship prominently
- ✅ Showcase devil fruits in Skills section
- ✅ Use character images in Hero/About

## Quick Option:

You could send me the list like:
- "Image 1 = Luffy character"
- "Image 2 = Devil fruit" 
- "Image 5 = 3D Ship"
etc.

Or just tell me which ones are "devil fruits" and which is the "ship" - I&apos;ll figure out the rest!

Let&apos;s make your portfolio absolutely stunning! 🏴‍☠️
