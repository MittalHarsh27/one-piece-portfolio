## ‚ùì What I Need From You:

Please help me rename these images by telling me what each one shows. For example:

- Devil fruits (for skills section)
- Characters (Luffy, Sanji, etc. for hero/about)
- Ship (3D view for backgrounds)
- Log Poses (for navigation)
- Treasure chests (for projects)
- Other One Piece elements

## üéØ Suggested Naming:

Once you tell me what each image is, I can rename them like:
- `devil-fruit-01.png`, `devil-fruit-02.png`
- `luffy-character.png`, `sanji-character.png`
- `ship-3d.png`
- `log-pose-01.png`
- `treasure-chest-01.png`
- etc.

## üìù How to Help:

You can either:
1. **List the images** and what they show (e.g., "Image 6 is a devil fruit")
2. **Describe the key images** you want me to use (especially the ship and devil fruits)
3. **Tell me which ones** are the "really really good" ones you mentioned

Then I'll rename them properly and integrate them throughout your portfolio for maximum visual impact!

Let me know what you see in your images! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
